		<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
		<p>I scarcely know where to begin, though I sometimes facetiously
		    place the cause of it all to Charley Furuseth’s
		    credit.&nbsp; He kept a summer cottage in Mill Valley, under the
		    shadow of Mount Tamalpais, and never occupied it except when he
		    loafed through the winter months and read Nietzsche and
		    Schopenhauer to rest his brain.&nbsp; When summer came on, he
		    elected to sweat out a hot and dusty existence in the city and to
		    toil incessantly.&nbsp; Had it not been my custom to run up to
		    see him every Saturday afternoon and to stop over till Monday
		    morning, this particular January Monday morning would not have
		    found me afloat on San Francisco Bay.
		</p>
		<p>Not but that I was afloat in a safe craft, for the
		    <i>Martinez</i> was a new ferry-steamer, making her fourth or
		    fifth trip on the run between Sausalito and San Francisco.&nbsp;
		    The danger lay in the heavy fog which blanketed the bay, and of
		    which, as a landsman, I had little apprehension.&nbsp; In fact, I
		    remember the placid exaltation with which I took up my position
		    on the forward upper deck, directly beneath the pilot-house, and
		    allowed the mystery of the fog to lay hold of my
		    imagination.&nbsp; A fresh breeze was blowing, and for a time I
		    was alone in the moist obscurity—yet not alone, for I was
		    dimly conscious of the presence of the pilot, and of what I took
		    to be the captain, in the glass house above my head.
		</p>
		<p>I remember thinking how comfortable it was, this division of
		    labour which made it unnecessary for me to study fogs, winds,
		    tides, and navigation, in order to visit my friend who lived
		    across an arm of the sea.&nbsp; It was good that men should be
		    specialists, I mused.&nbsp; The peculiar knowledge of the pilot
		    and captain sufficed for many thousands of people who knew no
		    more of the sea and navigation than I knew.&nbsp; On the other
		    hand, instead of having to devote my energy to the learning of a
		    multitude of things, I concentrated it upon a few particular
		    things, such as, for instance, the analysis of Poe’s place
		    in American literature—an essay of mine, by the way, in the
		    current <i>Atlantic</i>.&nbsp; Coming aboard, as I passed through
		    the cabin, I had noticed with greedy eyes a stout gentleman
		    reading the <i>Atlantic</i>, which was open at my very
		    essay.&nbsp; And there it was again, the division of labour, the
		    special knowledge of the pilot and captain which permitted the
		    stout gentleman to read my special knowledge on Poe while they
		    carried him safely from Sausalito to San Francisco.
		</p>
		<p>A red-faced man, slamming the cabin door behind him and
		    stumping out on the deck, interrupted my reflections, though I
		    made a mental note of the topic for use in a projected essay
		    which I had thought of calling “The Necessity for Freedom:
		    A Plea for the Artist.”&nbsp; The red-faced man shot a
		    glance up at the pilot-house, gazed around at the fog, stumped
		    across the deck and back (he evidently had artificial legs), and
		    stood still by my side, legs wide apart, and with an expression
		    of keen enjoyment on his face.&nbsp; I was not wrong when I
		    decided that his days had been spent on the sea.
		</p>
		<p>“It’s nasty weather like this here that turns
		    heads grey before their time,” he said, with a nod toward
		    the pilot-house.
		</p>
		<p>“I had not thought there was any particular
		    strain,” I answered.&nbsp; “It seems as simple as A,
		    B, C.&nbsp; They know the direction by compass, the distance, and
		    the speed.&nbsp; I should not call it anything more than
		    mathematical certainty.”
		</p>
		<p>“Strain!” he snorted.&nbsp; “Simple as A, B,
		    C!&nbsp; Mathematical certainty!”
		</p>
		<p>He seemed to brace himself up and lean backward against the
		    air as he stared at me.&nbsp; “How about this here tide
		    that’s rushin’ out through the Golden Gate?” he
		    demanded, or bellowed, rather.&nbsp; “How fast is she
		    ebbin’?&nbsp; What’s the drift, eh?&nbsp; Listen to
		    that, will you?&nbsp; A bell-buoy, and we’re a-top of
		    it!&nbsp; See ’em alterin’ the course!”
		</p>
		<p>From out of the fog came the mournful tolling of a bell, and I
		    could see the pilot turning the wheel with great rapidity.&nbsp;
		    The bell, which had seemed straight ahead, was now sounding from
		    the side.&nbsp; Our own whistle was blowing hoarsely, and from
		    time to time the sound of other whistles came to us from out of
		    the fog.
		</p>
		<p>“That’s a ferry-boat of some sort,” the
		    new-comer said, indicating a whistle off to the right.&nbsp;
		    “And there!&nbsp; D’ye hear that?&nbsp; Blown by
		    mouth.&nbsp; Some scow schooner, most likely.&nbsp; Better watch
		    out, Mr. Schooner-man.&nbsp; Ah, I thought so.&nbsp; Now
		    hell’s a poppin’ for somebody!”
		</p>
		<p>The unseen ferry-boat was blowing blast after blast, and the
		    mouth-blown horn was tooting in terror-stricken fashion.
		</p>
		<p>“And now they’re payin’ their respects to
		    each other and tryin’ to get clear,” the red-faced
		    man went on, as the hurried whistling ceased.
		</p>
		<p>His face was shining, his eyes flashing with excitement as he
		    translated into articulate language the speech of the horns and
		    sirens.&nbsp; “That’s a steam-siren a-goin’ it
		    over there to the left.&nbsp; And you hear that fellow with a
		    frog in his throat—a steam schooner as near as I can judge,
		    crawlin’ in from the Heads against the tide.”
		</p>
		<p>A shrill little whistle, piping as if gone mad, came from
		    directly ahead and from very near at hand.&nbsp; Gongs sounded on
		    the <i>Martinez</i>.&nbsp; Our paddle-wheels stopped, their
		    pulsing beat died away, and then they started again.&nbsp; The
		    shrill little whistle, like the chirping of a cricket amid the
		    cries of great beasts, shot through the fog from more to the side
		    and swiftly grew faint and fainter.&nbsp; I looked to my
		    companion for enlightenment.
		</p>
		<p>“One of them dare-devil launches,” he said.&nbsp;
		    “I almost wish we’d sunk him, the little rip!&nbsp;
		    They’re the cause of more trouble.&nbsp; And what good are
		    they?&nbsp; Any jackass gets aboard one and runs it from hell to
		    breakfast, blowin’ his whistle to beat the band and
		    tellin’ the rest of the world to look out for him, because
		    he’s comin’ and can’t look out for
		    himself!&nbsp; Because he’s comin’!&nbsp; And
		    you’ve got to look out, too!&nbsp; Right of way!&nbsp;
		    Common decency!&nbsp; They don’t know the meanin’ of
		    it!”
		</p>
		<p>I felt quite amused at his unwarranted choler, and while he
		    stumped indignantly up and down I fell to dwelling upon the
		    romance of the fog.&nbsp; And romantic it certainly was—the
		    fog, like the grey shadow of infinite mystery, brooding over the
		    whirling speck of earth; and men, mere motes of light and
		    sparkle, cursed with an insane relish for work, riding their
		    steeds of wood and steel through the heart of the mystery,
		    groping their way blindly through the Unseen, and clamouring and
		    clanging in confident speech the while their hearts are heavy
		    with incertitude and fear.
		</p>
		<p>The voice of my companion brought me back to myself with a
		    laugh.&nbsp; I too had been groping and floundering, the while I
		    thought I rode clear-eyed through the mystery.
		</p>
		<p>“Hello! somebody comin’ our way,” he was
		    saying.&nbsp; “And d’ye hear that?&nbsp; He’s
		    comin’ fast.&nbsp; Walking right along.&nbsp; Guess he
		    don’t hear us yet.&nbsp; Wind’s in wrong
		    direction.”
		</p>
		<p>The fresh breeze was blowing right down upon us, and I could
		    hear the whistle plainly, off to one side and a little ahead.
		</p>
		<p>“Ferry-boat?” I asked.</p>
		<p>He nodded, then added, “Or he wouldn’t be
		    keepin’ up such a clip.”&nbsp; He gave a short
		    chuckle.&nbsp; “They’re gettin’ anxious up
		    there.”
		</p>
		<p>I glanced up.&nbsp; The captain had thrust his head and
		    shoulders out of the pilot-house, and was staring intently into
		    the fog as though by sheer force of will he could penetrate
		    it.&nbsp; His face was anxious, as was the face of my companion,
		    who had stumped over to the rail and was gazing with a like
		    intentness in the direction of the invisible danger.
		</p>
		<p>Then everything happened, and with inconceivable
		    rapidity.&nbsp; The fog seemed to break away as though split by a
		    wedge, and the bow of a steamboat emerged, trailing fog-wreaths
		    on either side like seaweed on the snout of Leviathan.&nbsp; I
		    could see the pilot-house and a white-bearded man leaning partly
		    out of it, on his elbows.&nbsp; He was clad in a blue uniform,
		    and I remember noting how trim and quiet he was.&nbsp; His
		    quietness, under the circumstances, was terrible.&nbsp; He
		    accepted Destiny, marched hand in hand with it, and coolly
		    measured the stroke.&nbsp; As he leaned there, he ran a calm and
		    speculative eye over us, as though to determine the precise point
		    of the collision, and took no notice whatever when our pilot,
		    white with rage, shouted, “Now you’ve done
		    it!”
		</p>
		<p>On looking back, I realize that the remark was too obvious to
		    make rejoinder necessary.
		</p>
		<p>“Grab hold of something and hang on,” the
		    red-faced man said to me.&nbsp; All his bluster had gone, and he
		    seemed to have caught the contagion of preternatural calm.&nbsp;
		    “And listen to the women scream,” he said
		    grimly—almost bitterly, I thought, as though he had been
		    through the experience before.
		</p>
		<p>The vessels came together before I could follow his
		    advice.&nbsp; We must have been struck squarely amidships, for I
		    saw nothing, the strange steamboat having passed beyond my line
		    of vision.&nbsp; The <i>Martinez</i> heeled over, sharply, and
		    there was a crashing and rending of timber.&nbsp; I was thrown
		    flat on the wet deck, and before I could scramble to my feet I
		    heard the scream of the women.&nbsp; This it was, I am
		    certain,—the most indescribable of blood-curdling
		    sounds,—that threw me into a panic.&nbsp; I remembered the
		    life-preservers stored in the cabin, but was met at the door and
		    swept backward by a wild rush of men and women.&nbsp; What
		    happened in the next few minutes I do not recollect, though I
		    have a clear remembrance of pulling down life-preservers from the
		    overhead racks, while the red-faced man fastened them about the
		    bodies of an hysterical group of women.&nbsp; This memory is as
		    distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen.&nbsp; It
		    is a picture, and I can see it now,—the jagged edges of the
		    hole in the side of the cabin, through which the grey fog swirled
		    and eddied; the empty upholstered seats, littered with all the
		    evidences of sudden flight, such as packages, hand satchels,
		    umbrellas, and wraps; the stout gentleman who had been reading my
		    essay, encased in cork and canvas, the magazine still in his
		    hand, and asking me with monotonous insistence if I thought there
		    was any danger; the red-faced man, stumping gallantly around on
		    his artificial legs and buckling life-preservers on all comers;
		    and finally, the screaming bedlam of women.
		</p>
		<p>This it was, the screaming of the women, that most tried my
		    nerves.&nbsp; It must have tried, too, the nerves of the
		    red-faced man, for I have another picture which will never fade
		    from my mind.&nbsp; The stout gentleman is stuffing the magazine
		    into his overcoat pocket and looking on curiously.&nbsp; A
		    tangled mass of women, with drawn, white faces and open mouths,
		    is shrieking like a chorus of lost souls; and the red-faced man,
		    his face now purplish with wrath, and with arms extended overhead
		    as in the act of hurling thunderbolts, is shouting, “Shut
		    up!&nbsp; Oh, shut up!”
		</p>
		<p>I remember the scene impelled me to sudden laughter, and in
		    the next instant I realized I was becoming hysterical myself; for
		    these were women of my own kind, like my mother and sisters, with
		    the fear of death upon them and unwilling to die.&nbsp; And I
		    remember that the sounds they made reminded me of the squealing
		    of pigs under the knife of the butcher, and I was struck with
		    horror at the vividness of the analogy.&nbsp; These women,
		    capable of the most sublime emotions, of the tenderest
		    sympathies, were open-mouthed and screaming.&nbsp; They wanted to
		    live, they were helpless, like rats in a trap, and they
		    screamed.
		</p>
		<p>The horror of it drove me out on deck.&nbsp; I was feeling
		    sick and squeamish, and sat down on a bench.&nbsp; In a hazy way
		    I saw and heard men rushing and shouting as they strove to lower
		    the boats.&nbsp; It was just as I had read descriptions of such
		    scenes in books.&nbsp; The tackles jammed.&nbsp; Nothing
		    worked.&nbsp; One boat lowered away with the plugs out, filled
		    with women and children and then with water, and capsized.&nbsp;
		    Another boat had been lowered by one end, and still hung in the
		    tackle by the other end, where it had been abandoned.&nbsp;
		    Nothing was to be seen of the strange steamboat which had caused
		    the disaster, though I heard men saying that she would
		    undoubtedly send boats to our assistance.
		</p>
		<p>I descended to the lower deck.&nbsp; The <i>Martinez</i> was
		    sinking fast, for the water was very near.&nbsp; Numbers of the
		    passengers were leaping overboard.&nbsp; Others, in the water,
		    were clamouring to be taken aboard again.&nbsp; No one heeded
		    them.&nbsp; A cry arose that we were sinking.&nbsp; I was seized
		    by the consequent panic, and went over the side in a surge of
		    bodies.&nbsp; How I went over I do not know, though I did know,
		    and instantly, why those in the water were so desirous of getting
		    back on the steamer.&nbsp; The water was cold—so cold that
		    it was painful.&nbsp; The pang, as I plunged into it, was as
		    quick and sharp as that of fire.&nbsp; It bit to the
		    marrow.&nbsp; It was like the grip of death.&nbsp; I gasped with
		    the anguish and shock of it, filling my lungs before the
		    life-preserver popped me to the surface.&nbsp; The taste of the
		    salt was strong in my mouth, and I was strangling with the acrid
		    stuff in my throat and lungs.
		</p>
		<p>But it was the cold that was most distressing.&nbsp; I felt
		    that I could survive but a few minutes.&nbsp; People were
		    struggling and floundering in the water about me.&nbsp; I could
		    hear them crying out to one another.&nbsp; And I heard, also, the
		    sound of oars.&nbsp; Evidently the strange steamboat had lowered
		    its boats.&nbsp; As the time went by I marvelled that I was still
		    alive.&nbsp; I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs, while
		    a chilling numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into
		    it.&nbsp; Small waves, with spiteful foaming crests, continually
		    broke over me and into my mouth, sending me off into more
		    strangling paroxysms.
		</p>
		<p>The noises grew indistinct, though I heard a final and
		    despairing chorus of screams in the distance, and knew that the
		    <i>Martinez</i> had gone down.&nbsp; Later,—how much later
		    I have no knowledge,—I came to myself with a start of
		    fear.&nbsp; I was alone.&nbsp; I could hear no calls or
		    cries—only the sound of the waves, made weirdly hollow and
		    reverberant by the fog.&nbsp; A panic in a crowd, which partakes
		    of a sort of community of interest, is not so terrible as a panic
		    when one is by oneself; and such a panic I now suffered.&nbsp;
		    Whither was I drifting?&nbsp; The red-faced man had said that the
		    tide was ebbing through the Golden Gate.&nbsp; Was I, then, being
		    carried out to sea?&nbsp; And the life-preserver in which I
		    floated?&nbsp; Was it not liable to go to pieces at any
		    moment?&nbsp; I had heard of such things being made of paper and
		    hollow rushes which quickly became saturated and lost all
		    buoyancy.&nbsp; And I could not swim a stroke.&nbsp; And I was
		    alone, floating, apparently, in the midst of a grey primordial
		    vastness.&nbsp; I confess that a madness seized me, that I
		    shrieked aloud as the women had shrieked, and beat the water with
		    my numb hands.
		</p>
		<p>How long this lasted I have no conception, for a blankness
		    intervened, of which I remember no more than one remembers of
		    troubled and painful sleep.&nbsp; When I aroused, it was as after
		    centuries of time; and I saw, almost above me and emerging from
		    the fog, the bow of a vessel, and three triangular sails, each
		    shrewdly lapping the other and filled with wind.&nbsp; Where the
		    bow cut the water there was a great foaming and gurgling, and I
		    seemed directly in its path.&nbsp; I tried to cry out, but was
		    too exhausted.&nbsp; The bow plunged down, just missing me and
		    sending a swash of water clear over my head.&nbsp; Then the long,
		    black side of the vessel began slipping past, so near that I
		    could have touched it with my hands.&nbsp; I tried to reach it,
		    in a mad resolve to claw into the wood with my nails, but my arms
		    were heavy and lifeless.&nbsp; Again I strove to call out, but
		    made no sound.
		</p>
		<p>The stern of the vessel shot by, dropping, as it did so, into
		    a hollow between the waves; and I caught a glimpse of a man
		    standing at the wheel, and of another man who seemed to be doing
		    little else than smoke a cigar.&nbsp; I saw the smoke issuing
		    from his lips as he slowly turned his head and glanced out over
		    the water in my direction.&nbsp; It was a careless,
		    unpremeditated glance, one of those haphazard things men do when
		    they have no immediate call to do anything in particular, but act
		    because they are alive and must do something.
		</p>
		<p>But life and death were in that glance.&nbsp; I could see the
		    vessel being swallowed up in the fog; I saw the back of the man
		    at the wheel, and the head of the other man turning, slowly
		    turning, as his gaze struck the water and casually lifted along
		    it toward me.&nbsp; His face wore an absent expression, as of
		    deep thought, and I became afraid that if his eyes did light upon
		    me he would nevertheless not see me.&nbsp; But his eyes did light
		    upon me, and looked squarely into mine; and he did see me, for he
		    sprang to the wheel, thrusting the other man aside, and whirled
		    it round and round, hand over hand, at the same time shouting
		    orders of some sort.&nbsp; The vessel seemed to go off at a
		    tangent to its former course and leapt almost instantly from view
		    into the fog.
		</p>
		<p>I felt myself slipping into unconsciousness, and tried with
		    all the power of my will to fight above the suffocating blankness
		    and darkness that was rising around me.&nbsp; A little later I
		    heard the stroke of oars, growing nearer and nearer, and the
		    calls of a man.&nbsp; When he was very near I heard him crying,
		    in vexed fashion, “Why in hell don’t you sing
		    out?”&nbsp; This meant me, I thought, and then the
		    blankness and darkness rose over me.
		</p>
		<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
		<p>I seemed swinging in a mighty rhythm through orbit
		    vastness.&nbsp; Sparkling points of light spluttered and shot
		    past me.&nbsp; They were stars, I knew, and flaring comets, that
		    peopled my flight among the suns.&nbsp; As I reached the limit of
		    my swing and prepared to rush back on the counter swing, a great
		    gong struck and thundered.&nbsp; For an immeasurable period,
		    lapped in the rippling of placid centuries, I enjoyed and
		    pondered my tremendous flight.
		</p>
		<p>But a change came over the face of the dream, for a dream I
		    told myself it must be.&nbsp; My rhythm grew shorter and
		    shorter.&nbsp; I was jerked from swing to counter swing with
		    irritating haste.&nbsp; I could scarcely catch my breath, so
		    fiercely was I impelled through the heavens.&nbsp; The gong
		    thundered more frequently and more furiously.&nbsp; I grew to
		    await it with a nameless dread.&nbsp; Then it seemed as though I
		    were being dragged over rasping sands, white and hot in the
		    sun.&nbsp; This gave place to a sense of intolerable
		    anguish.&nbsp; My skin was scorching in the torment of
		    fire.&nbsp; The gong clanged and knelled.&nbsp; The sparkling
		    points of light flashed past me in an interminable stream, as
		    though the whole sidereal system were dropping into the
		    void.&nbsp; I gasped, caught my breath painfully, and opened my
		    eyes.&nbsp; Two men were kneeling beside me, working over
		    me.&nbsp; My mighty rhythm was the lift and forward plunge of a
		    ship on the sea.&nbsp; The terrific gong was a frying-pan,
		    hanging on the wall, that rattled and clattered with each leap of
		    the ship.&nbsp; The rasping, scorching sands were a man’s
		    hard hands chafing my naked chest.&nbsp; I squirmed under the
		    pain of it, and half lifted my head.&nbsp; My chest was raw and
		    red, and I could see tiny blood globules starting through the
		    torn and inflamed cuticle.
		</p>
		<p>“That’ll do, Yonson,” one of the men
		    said.&nbsp; “Carn’t yer see you’ve
		    bloomin’ well rubbed all the gent’s skin
		    orf?”
		</p>
		<p>The man addressed as Yonson, a man of the heavy Scandinavian
		    type, ceased chafing me, and arose awkwardly to his feet.&nbsp;
		    The man who had spoken to him was clearly a Cockney, with the
		    clean lines and weakly pretty, almost effeminate, face of the man
		    who has absorbed the sound of Bow Bells with his mother’s
		    milk.&nbsp; A draggled muslin cap on his head and a dirty
		    gunny-sack about his slim hips proclaimed him cook of the
		    decidedly dirty ship’s galley in which I found myself.
		</p>
		<p>“An’ ’ow yer feelin’ now, sir?”
		    he asked, with the subservient smirk which comes only of
		    generations of tip-seeking ancestors.
		</p>
		<p>For reply, I twisted weakly into a sitting posture, and was
		    helped by Yonson to my feet.&nbsp; The rattle and bang of the
		    frying-pan was grating horribly on my nerves.&nbsp; I could not
		    collect my thoughts.&nbsp; Clutching the woodwork of the galley
		    for support,—and I confess the grease with which it was
		    scummed put my teeth on edge,—I reached across a hot
		    cooking-range to the offending utensil, unhooked it, and wedged
		    it securely into the coal-box.
		</p>
		<p>The cook grinned at my exhibition of nerves, and thrust into
		    my hand a steaming mug with an “’Ere, this’ll
		    do yer good.”&nbsp; It was a nauseous
		    mess,—ship’s coffee,—but the heat of it was
		    revivifying.&nbsp; Between gulps of the molten stuff I glanced
		    down at my raw and bleeding chest and turned to the
		    Scandinavian.
		</p>
		<p>“Thank you, Mr. Yonson,” I said; “but
		    don’t you think your measures were rather
		    heroic?”
		</p>
		<p>It was because he understood the reproof of my action, rather
		    than of my words, that he held up his palm for inspection.&nbsp;
		    It was remarkably calloused.&nbsp; I passed my hand over the
		    horny projections, and my teeth went on edge once more from the
		    horrible rasping sensation produced.
		</p>
		<p>“My name is Johnson, not Yonson,” he said, in very
		    good, though slow, English, with no more than a shade of accent
		    to it.
		</p>
		<p>There was mild protest in his pale blue eyes, and withal a
		    timid frankness and manliness that quite won me to him.
		</p>
		<p>“Thank you, Mr. Johnson,” I corrected, and reached
		    out my hand for his.
		</p>
		<p>He hesitated, awkward and bashful, shifted his weight from one
		    leg to the other, then blunderingly gripped my hand in a hearty
		    shake.
		</p>
		<p>“Have you any dry clothes I may put on?” I asked
		    the cook.
		</p>
		<p>“Yes, sir,” he answered, with cheerful
		    alacrity.&nbsp; “I’ll run down an’ tyke a look
		    over my kit, if you’ve no objections, sir, to wearin’
		    my things.”
		</p>
		<p>He dived out of the galley door, or glided rather, with a
		    swiftness and smoothness of gait that struck me as being not so
		    much cat-like as oily.&nbsp; In fact, this oiliness, or
		    greasiness, as I was later to learn, was probably the most
		    salient expression of his personality.
		</p>
		<p>“And where am I?” I asked Johnson, whom I took,
		    and rightly, to be one of the sailors.&nbsp; “What vessel
		    is this, and where is she bound?”
		</p>
		<p>“Off the Farallones, heading about sou-west,” he
		    answered, slowly and methodically, as though groping for his best
		    English, and rigidly observing the order of my queries.&nbsp;
		    “The schooner <i>Ghost</i>, bound seal-hunting to
		    Japan.”
		</p>
		<p>“And who is the captain?&nbsp; I must see him as soon as
		    I am dressed.”
		</p>
		<p>Johnson looked puzzled and embarrassed.&nbsp; He hesitated
		    while he groped in his vocabulary and framed a complete
		    answer.&nbsp; “The cap’n is Wolf Larsen, or so men
		    call him.&nbsp; I never heard his other name.&nbsp; But you
		    better speak soft with him.&nbsp; He is mad this morning.&nbsp;
		    The mate—”
		</p>
		<p>But he did not finish.&nbsp; The cook had glided in.</p>
		<p>“Better sling yer ’ook out of ’ere,
		    Yonson,” he said.&nbsp; “The old man’ll be
		    wantin’ yer on deck, an’ this ayn’t no
		    d’y to fall foul of ’im.”
		</p>
		<p>Johnson turned obediently to the door, at the same time, over
		    the cook’s shoulder, favouring me with an amazingly solemn
		    and portentous wink as though to emphasize his interrupted remark
		    and the need for me to be soft-spoken with the captain.
		</p>
		<p>Hanging over the cook’s arm was a loose and crumpled
		    array of evil-looking and sour-smelling garments.
		</p>
		<p>“They was put aw’y wet, sir,” he vouchsafed
		    explanation.&nbsp; “But you’ll ’ave to make
		    them do till I dry yours out by the fire.”
		</p>
		<p>Clinging to the woodwork, staggering with the roll of the
		    ship, and aided by the cook, I managed to slip into a rough
		    woollen undershirt.&nbsp; On the instant my flesh was creeping
		    and crawling from the harsh contact.&nbsp; He noticed my
		    involuntary twitching and grimacing, and smirked:
		</p>
		<p>“I only ’ope yer don’t ever ’ave to
		    get used to such as that in this life, ’cos you’ve
		    got a bloomin’ soft skin, that you ’ave, more like a
		    lydy’s than any I know of.&nbsp; I was bloomin’ well
		    sure you was a gentleman as soon as I set eyes on yer.”
		</p>
		<p>I had taken a dislike to him at first, and as he helped to
		    dress me this dislike increased.&nbsp; There was something
		    repulsive about his touch.&nbsp; I shrank from his hand; my flesh
		    revolted.&nbsp; And between this and the smells arising from
		    various pots boiling and bubbling on the galley fire, I was in
		    haste to get out into the fresh air.&nbsp; Further, there was the
		    need of seeing the captain about what arrangements could be made
		    for getting me ashore.
		</p>
		<p>A cheap cotton shirt, with frayed collar and a bosom
		    discoloured with what I took to be ancient blood-stains, was put
		    on me amid a running and apologetic fire of comment.&nbsp; A pair
		    of workman’s brogans encased my feet, and for trousers I
		    was furnished with a pair of pale blue, washed-out overalls, one
		    leg of which was fully ten inches shorter than the other.&nbsp;
		    The abbreviated leg looked as though the devil had there clutched
		    for the Cockney’s soul and missed the shadow for the
		    substance.
		</p>
		<p>“And whom have I to thank for this kindness?” I
		    asked, when I stood completely arrayed, a tiny boy’s cap on
		    my head, and for coat a dirty, striped cotton jacket which ended
		    at the small of my back and the sleeves of which reached just
		    below my elbows.
		</p>
		<p>The cook drew himself up in a smugly humble fashion, a
		    deprecating smirk on his face.&nbsp; Out of my experience with
		    stewards on the Atlantic liners at the end of the voyage, I could
		    have sworn he was waiting for his tip.&nbsp; From my fuller
		    knowledge of the creature I now know that the posture was
		    unconscious.&nbsp; An hereditary servility, no doubt, was
		    responsible.
		</p>
		<p>“Mugridge, sir,” he fawned, his effeminate
		    features running into a greasy smile.&nbsp; “Thomas
		    Mugridge, sir, an’ at yer service.”
		</p>
		<p>“All right, Thomas,” I said.&nbsp; “I shall
		    not forget you—when my clothes are dry.”
		</p>
		<p>A soft light suffused his face and his eyes glistened, as
		    though somewhere in the deeps of his being his ancestors had
		    quickened and stirred with dim memories of tips received in
		    former lives.
		</p>
		<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said, very gratefully and
		    very humbly indeed.
		</p>
		<p>Precisely in the way that the door slid back, he slid aside,
		    and I stepped out on deck.&nbsp; I was still weak from my
		    prolonged immersion.&nbsp; A puff of wind caught me,—and I
		    staggered across the moving deck to a corner of the cabin, to
		    which I clung for support.&nbsp; The schooner, heeled over far
		    out from the perpendicular, was bowing and plunging into the long
		    Pacific roll.&nbsp; If she were heading south-west as Johnson had
		    said, the wind, then, I calculated, was blowing nearly from the
		    south.&nbsp; The fog was gone, and in its place the sun sparkled
		    crisply on the surface of the water, I turned to the east, where
		    I knew California must lie, but could see nothing save low-lying
		    fog-banks—the same fog, doubtless, that had brought about
		    the disaster to the <i>Martinez</i> and placed me in my present
		    situation.&nbsp; To the north, and not far away, a group of naked
		    rocks thrust above the sea, on one of which I could distinguish a
		    lighthouse.&nbsp; In the south-west, and almost in our course, I
		    saw the pyramidal loom of some vessel’s sails.
		</p>
		<p>Having completed my survey of the horizon, I turned to my more
		    immediate surroundings.&nbsp; My first thought was that a man who
		    had come through a collision and rubbed shoulders with death
		    merited more attention than I received.&nbsp; Beyond a sailor at
		    the wheel who stared curiously across the top of the cabin, I
		    attracted no notice whatever.
		</p>
		<p>Everybody seemed interested in what was going on amid
		    ships.&nbsp; There, on a hatch, a large man was lying on his
		    back.&nbsp; He was fully clothed, though his shirt was ripped
		    open in front.&nbsp; Nothing was to be seen of his chest,
		    however, for it was covered with a mass of black hair, in
		    appearance like the furry coat of a dog.&nbsp; His face and neck
		    were hidden beneath a black beard, intershot with grey, which
		    would have been stiff and bushy had it not been limp and draggled
		    and dripping with water.&nbsp; His eyes were closed, and he was
		    apparently unconscious; but his mouth was wide open, his breast,
		    heaving as though from suffocation as he laboured noisily for
		    breath.&nbsp; A sailor, from time to time and quite methodically,
		    as a matter of routine, dropped a canvas bucket into the ocean at
		    the end of a rope, hauled it in hand under hand, and sluiced its
		    contents over the prostrate man.
		</p>
		<p>Pacing back and forth the length of the hatchways and savagely
		    chewing the end of a cigar, was the man whose casual glance had
		    rescued me from the sea.&nbsp; His height was probably five feet
		    ten inches, or ten and a half; but my first impression, or feel
		    of the man, was not of this, but of his strength.&nbsp; And yet,
		    while he was of massive build, with broad shoulders and deep
		    chest, I could not characterize his strength as massive.&nbsp; It
		    was what might be termed a sinewy, knotty strength, of the kind
		    we ascribe to lean and wiry men, but which, in him, because of
		    his heavy build, partook more of the enlarged gorilla
		    order.&nbsp; Not that in appearance he seemed in the least
		    gorilla-like.&nbsp; What I am striving to express is this
		    strength itself, more as a thing apart from his physical
		    semblance.&nbsp; It was a strength we are wont to associate with
		    things primitive, with wild animals, and the creatures we imagine
		    our tree-dwelling prototypes to have been—a strength
		    savage, ferocious, alive in itself, the essence of life in that
		    it is the potency of motion, the elemental stuff itself out of
		    which the many forms of life have been moulded; in short, that
		    which writhes in the body of a snake when the head is cut off,
		    and the snake, as a snake, is dead, or which lingers in the
		    shapeless lump of turtle-meat and recoils and quivers from the
		    prod of a finger.
